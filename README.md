The workflow of the project is:

(1) Data processing: generate return date and volume data, see Data_Preprocessing.ipynb

(2) Backtest: code of the backtest module, and all the backtest results, see Backtest.ipynb

(3) Calculate single factors: see Single_Factors_Calculation.ipynb. The calculated results are saved under /factors

(4) Factor combination: see Factor_Combination.ipynb. The value of the combined factors are saved under facors/comb
